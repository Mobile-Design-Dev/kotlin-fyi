The course is spread over 5 weeks and should take ~25 hours to complete on a normal pace. I'll be checking it out soon!

I want to understand the language better and learn to use Kotlin more productively across the broad ecosystem of targets that it currently supports -- starting with Android. By sharing my journey on this site, I hope to do three things: Create a personal resource I can revisit when I need to. Provide a community resource for other learners, particularly beginners. Keep myself accountable by learning in public ! Bonus: I want to get into the practice of writing code and content consistently in the new year. Starting in December is a perfect way to crush that resolution! My motto will be: progress beats perfection - ship things as I go, then come back and clean up or update later as needed. My Motivation I recently started a new role as a mobile developer advocate within Microsoft Developer Relations , working with devices like the Surface Duo and cloud platforms like Azure , M365 and Power Platform . My mission is to help diverse developer audiences understand and use these platforms and technologies more effectively. And part of that process is to go where developers are and become innately familiar with their development environments and language preferences. Simply put, I want to help every mobile developer become more productive with cloud and AI. Why Kotlin? Android developers are a core audience given the ubiquity of Android devices worldwide and the emergence of new foldable devices like the Microsoft Surface Duo . While I've worked with Android in the past (in researcher, developer and faculty contexts), it was as a Java developer - the then-preferred programming language for Android. However in 2019 Google declared Android would be Kotlin First , signaling a deeper committment to Kotlin across their engineering, documentation and training objectives. In 2020, Jetbrains released Kotlin 1.4 with emphasis on expanding the scope for Kotlin usage to include server-side, native, web, and even data science, targets. Github ranked it #5 in fastest-growing languages, while Stack Overflow ranked it #13 in most popular languages for professional developers. In other words, this is a great time to learn Kotlin and join the community! What is #100DaysOfKotlin? This was inspired by the 100DaysOfCode challenge where you commit to working on a coding initiative every day for 100 days, leading to ingrained and consistent habits that improve your comprehension, retention and recall. I'm adopting a more flexible approach where I will: create an evolving roadmap of things I want to learn. document progress on the #100DaysOfCode page share updates on @kotlinfyi Follow @kotlinfyi","title":"Website"},{"location":"home/about/#about-kotlinfyi","text":"","title":"About Kotlin.FYI"},{"location":"home/about/#my-goal","text":"It is December 1, 2020 - and I'm embarking on a #100DaysOfKotlin journey.
