# Kotlin FYI

Hello and welcome!

My name is Nitya Narasimhan and I'm current a Senior Cloud Advocate on the [Developer Relations team at Microsoft](https://www.twitter.com/azureadvocates). My goal is to build content, code and community connections that can empower mobile and fusion team developers to achieve more.

While I worked extensively in mobile research and development in the past, my prior DevRel role did not require any Android or mobile development. However, when Microsoft launched [the Surface Duo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/android/) in 2020, that all changed and I knew I had to be part of this. So I joined the Mobile Advocacy team and here we are!

## What is Kotlin.FYI?

My goal is to create a living resource (website, repository and content) that would document my learning journey but also serve as a useful guide or resource for others taking a similar journey.

I also wanted to embrace the idea of _learning in public_, sharing both insights and failures with a growth mindset. I hope this reinforces the idea that _everyone_ has expertise in some things and gaps in others - that that there is more joy than shame in being a lifelong learner.

## Why Kotlin?

In 2017 Google made Kotlin [a first-class language for Android app development](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/google-makes-kotlin-a-first-class-language-for-writing-android-apps/) though Java remained its preferred or primary language of choice.

By 2019, that had changed and Kotlin was now the [preferred language for Android development](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/kotlin-is-now-googles-preferred-language-for-android-app-development/) - with a [Kotlin-First](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first) approach advocated for development.

In 2020, it's clear [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is expanding beyond Android and gaining mindshare in the developer community.

 *  It saw a [1.5X growth in active users](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/08/kotlin-1-4-released-with-a-focus-on-quality-and-performance/) with ~6M users having edited code at least once.
 * It was [ranked 5th fastest-growing](https://octoverse.github.com/) language in the 2019 GitHub Octoverse report.
 * It was [ranked 13th most-popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies) language in the 2020 Stack Overflow Survey of 65K devs. 
 * It [ranked #36 on the TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in Nov 2020; not a top-10 contender but likely to improve.
 * In Aug 2020, JetBrains released [Kotlin 1.4](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/08/kotlin-1-4-released-with-a-focus-on-quality-and-performance/) - seen as a major update for the language.

The [Kotlin 1.4.x releases](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/category/releases/) unveiled [new language features](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/08/kotlin-1-4-released-with-a-focus-on-quality-and-performance/) and broadened Kotlin reach to new targets including web ([Kotlin/JS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html)), server-side ([Kotlin/JVM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/server-overview.html)), embedded ([Kotlin/Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native-overview.html)), mobile multi-platform ([Kotlin/KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html)) and even data science ([Kotlin-Jupyter](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-science-overview.html)).

<br/> 

As a developer, I can see Kotlin expertise being a useful skill that lets me play in mobile, web, IoT, server-side and data science environments. 

As a Microsoft Cloud Advocate, I want to explore Kotlin usage in libraries or integrations for platforms like [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured), [M365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/?view=o365-worldwide) and [Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/)

## What's Next?

I'm setting up this repository and website to kickstart #100DaysOfKotlin exploration in Dec 2020. 

There is no dearth of resources available - my goal is to explore them in a systematic way and share learnings through code and content.
