## About Koans

Learning programming syntax thoroughly is hard without trawling the docs extensively. [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html) are handy exercises that teach you syntax _in coding contexts_, where you fix syntax problems in the koan to make the associated tests pass.

You can complete Koans [online](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview) using the interactive Playground, or use the `My Courses` tab in IntelliJ IDE to explore this (and other courses) interactively within the IDE. Existing Koans cover everything from basic syntax to collections and generics.
