# Hello Kotlinverse! :sparkle:

My name is [Nitya Narasimhan](https://twitter.com/nitya/). I'm a **Mobile / Cloud Advocate** on the Developer Relations team at Microsoft and I want to help everyone build beautiful experiences for mobile users at cloud scale. Learn more about me and this project [here](/about). 

This site is for anyone taking a Kotlin learning journey, with three trails initially:

 * **Core Kotlin** | focus on language syntax and foundational concepts.
 * **Kotlin + Android** | building professional mobile apps using best practices.
 * **Kotlin + Cloud** | scaling mobile apps with cloud services for scale.

??? info "Under The Hood: MkDocs-Material"

    The site was intentionally built with [Mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) and the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to mimic documentation guides. I hope it serves as a living _Kotlin Study Guide_ linking to both canonical and community-created resources of value.
