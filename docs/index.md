If you're a first-time visitor, the main purpose of this site is to document and share my learning journey with Kotlin. I have three goals: 

 * Improve my [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) development skills and keep them current.
 * Explore app development for [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/?WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi) and other [Foldable Android Devices](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables).
 * Explore cloud integration with Microsoft [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured&WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi), [M365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/?view=o365-worldwide&WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi) and [Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/?WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi) for Android.

**Under the hood: **
The site was built using [Mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and reflects my love for all things documentation! :heart:{: .heartbeat }. I'm still learning about its amazing features so expect the site to change and evolve as I explore this further!
