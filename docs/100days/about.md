This is inspired by the [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/about/) challenge where you commit to working on a coding initiative every day for 100 days, leading to ingrained and consistent habits that improve your comprehension, retention and recall. 

I kickstarted this in Dec 2020 and hope to make more progress over the holidays to establish a good routine for progress. Keep an eye on these three resources:

 - **[`Roadmap`](/100days/roadmap)**  :fontawesome-solid-arrow-circle-right: a guide to topics or resources I want to explore.
 - **[`Posts`](/100days/journal)** :fontawesome-solid-arrow-circle-right: a journal, recording progress as it happens.
 - **[`@kotlinfyi`](https://twitter.com/kotlinfyi)** :fontawesome-solid-arrow-circle-right: a social account, to share resources & amplify community.
