# Timelines and Rabbit Holes

The [roadmap](/100days/roadmap) is about what I want to cover over the 100 days. This **timeline** page tells you how I went about covering it. Hint: I am not always sequential in my journeys - but learning never is. Sometimes taking those detours and jumping into rabbit holes is part of the fun of discovery!
