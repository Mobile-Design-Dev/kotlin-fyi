# About Kotlin.FYI

## My Goal
It is December 1, 2020 - and I'm embarking on a #100DaysOfKotlin journey. I want to understand the language better and learn to use [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) more productively across the broad ecosystem of targets that it currently supports -- starting with Android.

By sharing my journey on this site, I hope to do three things:

 * Create a personal resource I can revisit when I need to.
 * Provide a community resource for other learners, particularly beginners.
 * Keep myself accountable by _learning in public_!

_Bonus:_ I want to get into the practice of writing code and content consistently in the new year. Starting in December is a perfect way to crush that resolution! My motto will be: `progress beats perfection` - ship things as I go, then come back and clean up or update later as needed.

## My Motivation

I recently started a new role as a mobile developer advocate within [Microsoft Developer Relations](https://twitter.com/azureadvocates), working with devices like the [Surface Duo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/?WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi) and cloud platforms like [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured&WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi), [M365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/?view=o365-worldwide&WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi) and [Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/?WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi). 

My mission is to help diverse developer audiences understand and use these platforms and technologies more effectively. And part of that process is to `go where developers are` and become innately familiar with their development environments and language preferences.

Simply put, I want to help every mobile developer become more productive with cloud and AI.

## Why Kotlin?

Android developers are a core audience given the ubiquity of Android devices worldwide and the emergence of new [foldable devices](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables) like the [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/?WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi). While I've worked with Android in the past (in researcher, developer and faculty contexts), it was as a Java developer - the then-preferred programming language for Android.

However in 2019 Google declared [Android](https://developer.android.com) would be [Kotlin First](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first), signaling a deeper [committment to Kotlin](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/12/androids-commitment-to-kotlin.html) across their engineering, documentation and training objectives. In 2020, Jetbrains released [Kotlin 1.4](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/08/kotlin-1-4-released-with-a-focus-on-quality-and-performance/) with emphasis on expanding the scope for Kotlin usage to include server-side, native, web, and even data science, targets. Github [ranked it #5](https://octoverse.github.com/) in fastest-growing languages, while Stack Overflow [ranked it #13](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies) in most popular languages for professional developers.

In other words, this is a great time to learn Kotlin and join the community!

## What is #100DaysOfKotlin?

This was inspired by the [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/about/) challenge where you commit to working on a coding initiative every day for 100 days, leading to ingrained and consistent habits that improve your comprehension, retention and recall. I'm adopting a more flexible approach where I will:

 - create an evolving [roadmap](home/roadmap) of things I want to learn.
 - document progress on the [#100DaysOfCode](home/timeline) page
 - share updates on [@kotlinfyi](https://twitter.com/kotlinfyi)
