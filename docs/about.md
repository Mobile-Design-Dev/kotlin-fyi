??? info "Under The Hood: MkDocs-Material"

    The site built with [Mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) and the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and intentionally designed to mimic documentation guides. I hope it serves as a living _Kotlin Study Guide_ linking to both canonical and community-created resources of value.

## About Me 

Hello! I'm Nitya. I'm a PhD and Polyglot interested in mobile, web and distributed systems.

My PhD explored survivability for distributed Java systems. I then spent the next decade working on mobile and ubiquitous computing research at Motorola, working on diverse next-generation mobile devices and development platforms. As an independent mobile and web developer, I explored both native (Android/Java) and cross-platform (Flutter/Dart, ReactNative/JS) technologies and tools.

I joined Microsoft Developer Relations in **2018** to focus on building developer programs as the North America lead, and took a break from active mobile development. But when Microsoft released the [Surface Duo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/android/) in **2020**, I knew it was time to get back to mobile dev!! :fontawesome-solid-mobile:{: .heartbeat}

## About KotlinFYI 

The Android developer ecosystem had evolved greatly in those 2 years. In 2019, Android went [Kotlin first](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first), a shift from the earlier "Java-first" approach. In 2020, JetBrains released [Kotlin 1.4](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/08/kotlin-1-4-released-with-a-focus-on-quality-and-performance/), unveiling plans and early previews that extend Kotlin's reach to multiplatform solutions including mobile, server-side, native, web and data science. It was time to skill up on Kotlin.

But learning a new language requires resources and a preliminary roadmap to guide your learning journey. This is where I hope this site comes in. To help me organize and share my learning journey in a way that might help others following suit. Join me!
