# Hello, Foldables!

## Overview

??? question "What are Foldables?"

    The term "Foldables" refers here to smartphones that fold, giving rise to mobile devices that effectively have two operating modes based on their state ("folded" and "unfolded") -- leading to developer challenges in adapting the user experience and interactions to suit both the _user intent_ and _device features_ that are available in the current mode.

    Currently, you can think of devices embracing one of two approaches:
    * Fold-in | Clamshell - where a large smartphone can be folded (like a flip-phone)) to make it more compact for portability.
    * Fold-out | Tablet - where  a large smartphone can be expanded into a larger display area for immersive experiences or productivity.


??? question "Why should Kotlin developers care?"

    Currently, most ([if not all](https://www.androidheadlines.com/what-are-android-foldables)) foldable devices run on Android. And Kotlin is now the preferred language for Android development - so if you are a Kotlin Android developer, it's a good time to explore the ecosystem.
    
    Android 10, added more support for [building apps for foldables](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables) and devices like the [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo?activetab=overview) are embracing [dual screen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/?WT.mc_id=mobile-9644-ninarasi) form factors that can enable new solutions for consumers (immersive experiences) and enterprises (productivity apps).

## Plan 

To explore app development with Kotlin, I added a [500 Foldables](/home/roadmap/#500-foldable-devices) trail with two main branches:

| Trail | Topic | Description |
|:---   | :---     | :---        |
| 501 | [Foldable Apps For Android](/home/roadmap/#501-foldable-android-apps) | Android SDK support for foldables, design patterns for the _general category_ of foldables|
| 502 | [Dual Screen Apps for Microsoft Surface Duo](/home/roadmap/#502-microsoft-surface-duo) | Surface Duo SDK usage, design patterns for _dual-screen category_ of foldables |
