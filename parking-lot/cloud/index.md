# Cloud Integrations For the Kotlin Developer

## Plan

As a Kotlin developer, you might find Android development to be the most mature path even as  JetBrains builds support for multi-platform development (web, server-side, data science etc.).

And as an Android app developer you will likely need to pair your front-end (app) development with back-end (services and infrastructure) support that can enable, automate, scale and enhance the various user scenarios you require.

This is where cloud integrations can help. This section is the starting point to explore various cloud provider services and SDKs, understanding their products, the user scenarios enabled, and the SDKS/libraries available to a Kotlin developer for this purpose. 

The ecosystem is vast so I created a [600 Cloud](/home/roadmap/#400-kotlin-cloud) trail with four main branches to explore


| Trail | Topic | Description |
|:---   | :---     | :---        |
| 601 | [Core Concepts](/home/roadmap/#601-core-concepts) | Understand fundamental cloud computing concepts, architectures and solutions |
| 602 | [Microsoft Azure](/home/roadmap/#602-microsoft-azure) | Explore [Microsoft Azure](/cloud/azure) services, solutions and SDKS |
| 603 | [Google Firebase](/home/roadmap/#603-firebase) | Explore Google Firebase services, solutions and SDKs |
| 604 | [Kotlin + Server](/home/roadmap/#604-kotlin-server-side) | Explore JetBrains' emerging options for server-side development with Kotlin |
